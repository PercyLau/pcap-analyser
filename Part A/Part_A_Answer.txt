 Part A Wireshark Programming Task 

1.  Count the number of TCP flows initiated from the sender - 3
Calculated the number of tcp connections by counting the number of (syn,ack) packets, every (syn,ack) denotes a successful handshake.


2.  For each TCP flow 
 ———> A) For the first 2 transactions after the TCP connection is set up (from sender to receiver), get the values of the Sequence number, Ack number, and Receive Window size. Explain these values. 
            		    Connection 1 -  First two transactions after establishing connection
                    ◦       
			    sequence number -  705669103 acknowledgement number -  1921750144 window size -  3						                             			    			    sequence number -  705669127 acknowledgement number -  1921750144 window size -  3

	                    Connection 2 - First two transactions after establishing connection

                            sequence number -  3636173852 acknowledgement number -  2335809728 window size -  3
                            sequence number -  3636173876 acknowledgement number -  2335809728 window size -  3

			     Connection 3 - First two transactions after establishing connection

			     sequence number -  2558634630 acknowledgement number -  3429921723 window size -  3
			     sequence number -  2558634654 acknowledgement number -  3429921723 window size -  3


			If we consider connection 1:
			
			Transaction 1 
				- sender has sent a segment starting from 705669103th byte, the next byte that i expect from you starts at 1921750144.
				- reciever has sent a segment starting from 1921750144th byte, the next byte that i expect from you starts at 705669127.
			Transaction 2
				- sender has sent a segment starting from 705669127th byte, the next byte that i expect from you starts at 1921750144.
				- reciever has sent a segment starting from 1921750144th byte, the next byte that i expect from you starts at 705669254.


			Similarly for connections 2 and 3
												  


———> B) Compute the throughput for data sent from source to destination. To estimate throughput count all data and headers. You need to figure out how to define throughput in terms of what you are including as part of the throughput estimation. 

         To calculate throughput, packet size is used to calculate the total packet size across source & destination. Timestamp field is used over the first and last packet, to find the total time taken for sending all packets across source & destination. Throughput = (total packet size) / total time taken.

		Connection 1 
			Estimated Throughput = 42.01083443468604 MegaBit/second  
			Theoretical throughput = (square_root(3/2) * MSS) / (square_root(p) * RTT) = 8.1854328 MegaBit/second
		Connection 2 - 
			Estimated Throughput = 10.283294663924096 MegaBit/second 
			Theoretical throughput =  (square_root(3/2) * MSS) / (square_root(p) * RTT) = 1.6972836 MegaBit/second
		Connection 3 - 
			Throughput = 11.851251375691238 MegaBit/second 
			Estimated throughput = (square_root(3/2) * MSS) / (square_root(p) * RTT) = 5.258245 MegaBit/second


		Compare - Theoretical throughput < empirical throughput
		Explanation - 	To achieve the calculated throughput of 42 MegaBit/second, we need the loss rate to be .000024 seconds that is one loss for 50000 segments. However we have around 11000 segments. SO we can’t achieve the empirical throughput.






———> C) Compute the loss rate for each flow. Loss rate is the number of packets not received divided by the number of packets sent. Loss rate is an application layer metric. So think about what makes sense when defining loss rate. 
		Loss is calculated by counting the retransmissions of a packet with the same sequence number. If a sequence number appears multiple times then packet is lost and sender has to resend it. Total loss =  (Total number of packets which are retransmitted).

Loss rate = total loss/ total number of packets.

		Connection 1 - Loss Rate = 0.0005733123118818977
		Connection 2 - Loss Rate = 0.013440860215053764
		Connection 3 - Loss Rate = 0.0013717421124828531






———> D) Estimate the average RTT. Now compare your empirical throughput from (b) and the theoretical throughput (estimated using the formula derived in class). Explain your comparison. 
		For calculating RTT, Time stamps of all the packets sent are stored from both sender to receiver and from receiver to sender in a dictionary where key = sequence number of the packet. For every packet sent, sequence number from sender to receiver  = acknowledgment number from receiver to sender’s packet. Difference in time between a packet sent with sequence number x ant the corresponding packet’s acknowledgment number from receiver to sender is calculated . Average RTT = ( total time taken / total no. of transactions )

		Connection 1 - Average RTT = 73.00400733947754 milliseconds 
		Connection 2 - Average RTT = 72.70503044128418 milliseconds 
		Connection 3 - Average RTT = 73.50778579711914 milliseconds 


		Empirical throughput is compared in against theoretical output in B bit itself.
